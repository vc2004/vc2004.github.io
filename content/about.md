This is Liang Dong's blog about thinking and learning in networking and also other interesting stuff. I got 7 years of experiences in telco networking and 3 years in SDN/NFV in cloud networking, datacenter and enterprise networking, and most recently on Linux networking. Also I am trying to learning some Data Sciences. Any comments please feel free to email me.
